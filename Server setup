Server setup:
On Amazon EC2 create instance:
  Name: Lebron-Fanpage
  AMI: Ubuntu Server
  Create a Key Pair (.pem file) NAME: MasterKey
  Allow SSH HTTP AND HTTPS
  Click Launch Instance
Connect to the server
  Find Public Ip: 13.238.120.156
  open gitbash on your desktop 
  have your .pem key on your desktop too (can be anywhere but this takes out finding the path and extra writing)
  Chmod 400 MasterKey.pem
  ssh -i Masterkey.pem ubuntu@13.238.120.156
  Type Yes
Update server and install nginx for web servers
  sudo apt update 
  sudo apt install nginx -y
  sudo systemctl start nginx
  sudo systemctl enable nginx
  type 13.238.120.156 in a web browser and nginx should be there if not server restart
Installing php For the website
  sudo apt update 
  sudo apt install php-fpm php-mysq1
  sudo systemctl start php8.3-fpm
  sudo systemctl enable php8.3-fpm
Now everything is downloaded you must make sure nginx and php can communicate 
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
  now find the block for php and update it 
It looks like this 
 location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.3-fpm.sock; 
make sure the correct version is being used same as the one download e.g. 8.3 for this example 
your total page should look like this:
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    server_name your_domain_or_ip;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    # pass PHP scripts to FastCGI server
    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;  # <-- Check your PHP version, e.g. php7.4-fpm.sock or php8.1-fpm.sock
    }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }
}
control x then press enter 
TESTING -
  ls /var/run/php

Now everything should be downloaded onto your server all you have to do is upload your html/php files
To upload html files find the path on your computer 
example: c:\user\downloads\
now that you have the path 
type exit twice in your console to get back to main 
  type(do this for every html file):
  scp -i MasterKey.pem "C:\user\locationofHtmlfile\index.html" ubuntu@13.238.120.156:~
  (this uploads your html files to \home\ section on your server)
now you need to move the files to /var/www/html/
ssh into your server ( ssh -i MasterKey.pem ubuntu@13.238.120.156)
  sudo mv ~/index.html /var/www/html/
Do that for every file now they all should be updated in the server 
check IP 13.238.120.156 in web browser 
Common errors i ran into:

incorrect version in php socket
  fixed by going into the file and editing like above
Invalid permissions 
  fixed by code bellow
    sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/index.html
   sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/index.html
  allows permissions for those files
